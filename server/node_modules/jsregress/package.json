Still very much under development. All working features tested for accuracy.\n\n`npm install jsregress`\n\n##Currently working\n* [Univariate statistics](https://github.com/cjqed/jsRegress/wiki/Univariate)\n    * Mean\n    * Standard deviation\n* ANOVA\n    * [Completely randomized design](https://github.com/cjqed/jsRegress/wiki/Anova---Completely-Randomized-Design)\n* Regression\n    * [Multiple linear regression](https://github.com/cjqed/jsRegress/wiki/Multiple-Linear-Regression)\n* Non-parametrics\n    * [Mann-Whitney U](https://github.com/cjqed/jsRegress/wiki/Mann-Whitney-U)\n\n##Planned features\n\n* Univariate statistics\n* Multivariate statistics\n* Regression\n* More ANOVA\n* Non-parametric statistics\n* Categorical Data Analysis\n\n##Why a statistical package in node?\n\nYes, you could get all this and more in R or SAS and yes computing the Mann-Whitney U in SAS will probably be quicker than computing it in a single-threaded node.js instance. However, sometimes you don't need the best performance, and sometimes you just want to stay in node. This library is for people running statistical tests as a part of a larger Node.js system. Or it's for people that just love javascript (Like I do!)\n",
